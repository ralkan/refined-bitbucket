# refined-bitbucket
We all know Bitbucket lacks some features that we have in GitHub, GitLab etc.
Based on Sindre Sorhus' [Refined Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github)
extension I had the idea of improving BitBucket's user interface.
In fact, [Rodrigo Proença](https://github.com/rproenca) did most of the initial code and I just created the extension
and made a few improvements. Kudos!

## Current features
- Improves syntax highlight for pull requests. Enabled languages:
  - Markup, C-like languages, Go, Groovy, Bash, Handlebars, JSON, Dart, Elixir, Erlang, Markdown, Python, React JSX, 
  Ruby, PHP, Scala, Less, Sass, Swift, YAML, etc. [See the full list](https://github.com/andremw/refined-bitbucket/blob/dev/src/syntax-highlight/language-ext.js). Missing any 
  language? [Let me know](https://github.com/andremw/refined-bitbucket/issues) or submit a pull request!
- Double click on a word to highlight all occurrences.
- Block pull request merging without a minimum number of approvals (defaults to 2 minimum approvals).

## Installing
Refined Bitbucket is [available on the Google Chrome Web Store][chrome-install].

## Usage

Refined BitBucket now supplies a key binding feature, which allows for quicker
navigation through pull requests.

### Default Key Mapping

The following are the default key mappings

#### Tab Selection
![bitbucket pull request tabs][tab-image]

Key | Action
--- | ---
<kbd>1</kbd> | Selects the **Overview** tab
<kbd>2</kbd> | Selects the **Commits** tab
<kbd>3</kbd> | Selects the **Activity** tab

#### Page Navigation and Scrolling

*Upper case letters mean that you need to press shift and the letter*

Key | Action
--- | ---
<kbd>N</kbd> | Scrolls to the **N**ext comment on the page.
<kbd>P</kbd> | Scrolls to the **P**revious comment on the page.
<kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>g</kbd> | Scrolls to the top of the page
<kbd>G</kbd> | Scrolls to the bottom of the page

### Compiling & Contributing
Contributions are very appreciated!

There are a few dependencies required to compile the plugin. To install them, run:

```
npm install
```

Then you'll just need to run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create the `extension.js` file and test
the code you write and load the unpackaged extension in your Chrome. If you're
new to Chrome extension development, take some time to read Google's
[documentation on extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions).

#### Integration

There is a test suite included. Before sending a pull request please make
sure all tests are passing by running:

```
npm test
```
